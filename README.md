# Abdullah's Portfolio

This is my personal website. It shares who I am, what I’ve built, and what I’m learning. The site includes my bio, resume, and a few projects I'm working on.

Built with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. Deployed with [your deployment method, e.g. Vercel, GitHub Pages].

## 🚀 Setup

Clone the repo and open `index.html` in a browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio.git
````

Or open directly in a code editor and use a local server.

## 🛠 Customizing

You can update the content by editing the HTML files. All styling is in the `styles/` folder. Scripts, if used, are in `scripts/`.

## 🤝 Contributing
